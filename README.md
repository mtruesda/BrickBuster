# BrickBuster Project

## Description

I am planning to use python to build a more refined version of my brickbuster game from AP CSP create task. I am going to try to use threading while making this to get the ball to move independently  of what the player is actively doing.

## Updates

@Version 06/27/22 : I just put together the basic tkinter pieces and imports. Not much was completed.
